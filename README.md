               <h2>Is anime for kids?</h2>
               <p>Many people see anime as a cartoon for little children but what they don't know is that the storyline, plot and characters don't apply with the kids mindset. Basically, kids see cartoons as playful random things laughing and having fun.                               e death, killings. and crime. I understand some can be good to kids but majority of them maybe not as they will probably include a little nudity or landguage in them.</p>
